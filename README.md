The numbers are in! Which breed will be named the American Kennel Club’s most popular dog breed of 2022? As the world’s largest registry of purebred dogs, the AKC uses our registration statistics to rank the most popular breeds of the past year.

And for the first time in history, 2022 found the French Bulldog taking the No. 1 spot. This ends the Labrador Retriever’s 31-year reign as the most popular dog breed in America.

The New Top Dog
The French Bulldog has moved into the number one position after climbing the ranks in popularity over the last ten years. In 2012, the Frenchie was ranked at No. 14. Since then, registrations have increased by over 1,000%, bringing this playful breed to the top. French Bulldogs held the No. 2 spot in 2021.

Breaking the Lab’s top-dog status of over three decades is no small feat. The Frenchie is a smart, compact breed, and they can fit into various different lifestyles, perfect for people all across the country. This petite dog was first recognized by the AKC in 1898; they are beloved by everyone from families to single owners for their charming and adaptable nature. They have surged in popularity in cities across the country since their small size and generally quiet demeanor make them good fits for apartments and smaller homes.

Top Five Dog Breeds of 2022
Aside from this massive move, the top five list looks a bit familiar. The Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd Dog, and Poodle take ranks two through five, respectively. Rottweilers moved from No. 8 to No. 7, while the Dachshund bumped the German Shorthaired Pointer from No. 9 in 2021 to No. 10 in 2022.

Other breeds that made major jumps from 2021 to 2022 are the American Hairless Terrier, Gordon Setter, Italian Greyhound, and Anatolian Shepherd Dog. Over the last ten years, breeds like the Cane Corso, Belgian Malinois, Giant Schnauzer, and English Cocker Spaniel have been making their way up the rankings in popularity, as well.

Newly recognized by the AKC in 2022, the Mudi and Russian Toy debuted at No. 150 and No. 144—not bad for their first year! The Bracco Italiano became the 200th breed fully recognized by the AKC in July of 2022; as a result, it will debut in the registration rankings for 2023.

Least Popular Dog Breeds of 2022
At the bottom of the list (Nos. 197 through 199) are the Sloughi, Norwegian Lundehund, and English Foxhound. Last year, the Norwegian Lundehund was at the bottom, but they have surpassed English Foxhounds in registration over the past year. English Foxhounds, like their American Foxhound cousins, were bred as agile, scent-driven hunting dogs.

The American Kennel Club, which was founded in 1884, recognizes 200 breeds, with additional breeds working their way toward recognition comprising the AKC Foundation Stock Service (FSS) and the Miscellaneous Class. If you’re looking for a puppy of your own, AKC Marketplace can connect you with a responsible breeder.

Knowing your dog will be counted as part of the compilation of the annual breed popularity list is only a small benefit of dog registration; the AKC is the only purebred dog registry in the United States that maintains systematic inspections and investigations. The AKC conducts thousands of inspections each year to ensure compliance with standards that support the welfare, safety, and health of dogs across the nation. The AKC and its affiliates have also donated over $67 million to canine health research as of 2022, and donated its 100th AKC Pet Disaster Relief Trailer in November of 2022.
